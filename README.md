# GoogleMapsShowMarkers
This AJAX project uses Google Maps API and has a loop that adds markers to the display for all the addresses in the phonebook.

The objective/specs for this project are as follows:

When a name is searched in the HTML document, the map should be centered on the address associated with the name, and a marker should be placed at the address.

You should also use a loop to place markers at all addresses stored in your XML document. This means that if there are five entries in the XML document there should be five markers on the map.
